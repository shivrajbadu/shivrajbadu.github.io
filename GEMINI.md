## 1. CLI Custom Instructions

### Git Automation Workflow

When I use any of these trigger phrases, automatically execute the complete git workflow:

**Trigger Phrases:**

- "Create Blog post for my website shivrajbadu.com.np"
- "commit and push"
- "save changes"
- "deploy"
- "update repo"
- "save work"
- "push to github"

**Automated Steps:**

1. Run `git status` to check current state
2. Execute `git add .` to stage all changes
3. Generate meaningful commit message based on file changes
4. Run `git commit -m "[generated message]"`
5. Execute `git push` to current branch

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Do **not** actually push to GitHub ‚Äî I will review and push manually.

---

### Commit Message Convention

Follow **Conventional Commit** format:

- `feat:` ‚Äî New features
- `fix:` ‚Äî Bug fixes
- `docs:` ‚Äî Documentation or blog post changes
- `style:` ‚Äî Formatting or structure only
- `refactor:` ‚Äî Code restructuring
- `chore:` ‚Äî Maintenance or configuration
- `update:` ‚Äî General updates

**Examples:**

- Blog post ‚Üí `docs: add [topic] blog post`
- Code ‚Üí `feat: implement [feature]`
- Config ‚Üí `chore: update [config]`
- Mixed changes ‚Üí `update: [brief summary]`

## 2. ‚úçÔ∏è Blog Writing Rule Set

### Purpose

This section defines the **structure, tone, and format** for all blog posts written for  
[`shivrajbadu.com.np`](https://shivrajbadu.com.np).  
When I say ‚ÄúCreate blog post‚Ä¶‚Äù or similar, follow these rules exactly ‚Äî no need to ask for formatting details again.

---

### Blog Post Format

Each post **must begin** with a Jekyll front matter block:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Full Title of the Post"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0545
categories: [Category1, Category2]
tags: [tag-one, tag-two, tag-three]
---
```

Then continue in Markdown format:

# [Title of the Blog]

## Introduction

(A concise intro that sets up the theme or question.)

## Main Sections

(Divide ideas or technical concepts using `##` headings.)

## Code / Technical Section

(Include properly fenced code blocks and explanations.)

## Conclusion

(Summarize learnings, provide final insight or reflection.)

## Suggested Reading

(A short Markdown list of related articles, books, or docs.)

Code / Technical Section Rules

When writing about code, use fenced Markdown code blocks with language tags:

## Code Example: Generating Embeddings with Ollama

````bash
ollama run qwen2.5-coder "Write a Ruby method to calculate factorial."

Explanation

Use commented code where appropriate

Provide short contextual commentary under the block

Highlight important commands or lines using bold or inline backticks

Include prerequisites, installation steps, or environment notes as needed


Supported syntax highlighting languages include `ruby`, `js`, `bash`, `python`, `yaml`, `html`, `json`, `sql`, and more.

### Tone & Style Guide

- **Voice:** Thoughtful, calm, technically competent, and reflective.
- **Tone:** Professional but conversational ‚Äî like teaching a peer.

  - Keep paragraphs short and readable
