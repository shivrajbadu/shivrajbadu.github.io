In Python, a variable is a named location used to store data in memory. Variables are fundamental to programming, allowing you to label and manipulate data in your code.

### Creating Variables

Creating a variable in Python is as simple as assigning a value to a name:

```python
# A variable storing a number
x = 10

# A variable storing a string
name = "Shiv"

# A variable storing a boolean
is_active = True
```

Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to declare the type of the variable. The type is inferred from the value you assign.

### Naming Rules

When naming variables, there are a few rules to follow:

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
- A variable name cannot start with a number.
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and \_ ).
- Variable names are case-sensitive (`age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are three different variables).

### Using Variables

Once you've created a variable, you can use it in your code:

```python
print(x)        # Output: 10
print(name)     # Output: Shiv
```

Variables make your code more readable and easier to maintain. They are a core concept you'll use in every Python program you write.
